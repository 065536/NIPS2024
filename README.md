# Implementations of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

This (WIP) repository contains:

* PyTorch implementations of deep reinforcement learning algorithms
* Analysis of algorithm performance in different game environments


### **Algorithms Implemented** 

1. Deep Q Learning
1. Deep Q Learning with Fixed Q Targets
1. Double Deep Q Learning
1. Double Deep Q Learning with Prioritised Experience Replay
1. REINFORCE
1. Hill Climbing
7. Genetic Evolution


### **Environments Tested**

1. Cart Pole


### **Results**

Because results can vary greatly each run, each agent plays the game 10 times and we show the *median* result. 
We show the results in terms of number of episodes taken to reach the required score
and also time taken. The algorithms were run on a 2017 Macbook Pro (no GPUs were used).
